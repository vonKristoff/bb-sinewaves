###Sine Waves via Backbone

A canvas sine wave manipulator SPA, built as a framework expose with `Backbone`.

Doubles up as a nice template draft using `require js` and `gulp` for preprocessing the `jade` html and `stylus` css.

Multiple canvas's are deployed, but a single render engine handles their draw schedule. Performance is great.
